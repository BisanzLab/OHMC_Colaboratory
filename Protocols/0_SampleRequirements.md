# Sample Requirements
As part of our [OHMC intake form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_bf0vcHt3guk7WsG8oIauOn-sQyKhWgnjc6DdQ59mZg/edit?ts=668fe9ee), please include your [sample metadata sheet](https://github.com/BisanzLab/OHMC_Colaboratory/blob/main/Templates/Metadata.xlsx) and [extraction plate template](Templates/0_ExtractionPlate_Template.xlsx) (tab 2 plate map). To access the form, you will need to log in to Google with your PSU ID and password.
All samples must start with a prefix that has been assigned for the project by Bethany. This prefix is unique and can only be used for one sequencing run.
This allows us to efficiently track your samples through the downstream processes.

## Sample Naming
Samples must be only letters, numbers, and underscores. No other characters including spaces are permitted.

The following **CAN NOT** be found in sample names: _S[0-9]+_ , _R[0-9]_, fastq, gz, _L[0-9]+_

No sample names can be repeated. 
Please check that all sample names are unique (This includes the controls).
It is generally a good idea to include some experimental information in the sample name to aid in identification, such as treatment or particpant ID.

**Examples of good names:**

Bisanz1_Mouse1Group1

Bethany1_Participant42

Susan6_Mouse3Cdiff

**Examples of bad names:**

Sample1

NegativeControl

S1

Bisanz1_Cdiff+fecal transplant


**Controls:**
Please remember to assign unique names to any controls. When extracting DNA, please include an extraction control (ExtCon) as a negative control. Positive and negative controls will be added to plates during primary PCR.

**Examples of good control names:**

ProjectID_ZymoCom_Plate[1]_[12]

ProjectID_ZymoDNA_Plate[0-9]_[Well]

ProjectID_ExtCon_Plate[0-9]_[Well]

ProjectID_NTC_Plate[0-9]_[Well]


## Physical Storage
For DNA extractions on the QiaCube, please obtain a 96-well PowerBead plate from the Collaboratory ahead of time for your samples.
Generally 50-200ul (or 50-200mg) sample are good amounts for extraction.

For DNA, please have your samples arrayed in fully skirted 96-well plates according to your index tracking sheet. Concentrations of >1ng/ul for microbial DNA will give the best chance for success.
Concentrations should be 10ng/ul by Qubit or >30ng/ul by Nanodrop with 260/280 >1.4.

Please have your samples appropriately labeled with your Project ID, name, and date. 
For a sealed skirted 96-well plate, a label with Project ID, name, and date placed on the side is sufficient. 
For individual samples, please array labeled samples in PCR strip tubes in order in a 2" cardboard box with a label of Project ID, name, and date. 

## Sample Shipping
Upon submission of the OHMC request form, you will receive an email from us to coordinate sample hand off and timing.
