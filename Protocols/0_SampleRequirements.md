# Sample Requirements
As part of our [request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1_bf0vcHt3guk7WsG8oIauOn-sQyKhWgnjc6DdQ59mZg/edit?ts=668fe9ee), please include your sample metadata sheet which you can download through the form or [here](https://github.com/BisanzLab/OHMC_Colaboratory/blob/main/Templates/Metadata.xlsx) 
This allows us to efficiently track your samples through the downstream processes.

## Sample Naming
Samples must be only letters, numbers, and underscores. No other characters including spaces are permitted.
The following **CAN NOT** be found in sample names: _S[0-9]+_ , _R[0-9]_, fastq, gz, _L[0-9]+_
No sample names can be repeated. Please check all sample names are unique (This includes the controls)

**Examples of good names:**
Bisanz1_Mouse1Group1
Bethany1_Participant42
Susan6_Mouse3Cdiff

**Examples of bad names:**
Sample1
NegativeControl
S1
Bisanz1_Cdiff+fecal transplant

**Controls:**
Please remember to assign unique names to any controls.
**Examples of good control names:**
ProjectID_ZymoCom_Plate[0-9]_[Well]
ProjectID_ZymoDNA_Plate[0-9]_[Well]
ProjectID_ExtCon_Plate[0-9]_[Well]
ProjectID_NTC_Plate[0-9]_[Well]

## Physical Storage
For DNA extractions on the QiaCube, please obtain a 96-well PowerBead plate from the Collaboratory ahead of time for your samples.
Generally 50-200ul (or 50-200mg) sample are good amounts for extraction.

For DNA, please have your samples arrayed in fully skirted 96-well plates according to your metadata sheet. Concentrations of >1ng/ul for microbial DNA will give the best chance for success.

Please have your samples appropriately labeled with your Project ID, name, and date. 
For a sealed skirted 96-well plate, a label with Project ID, name, and date.placed on the side is sufficient. 
For individual samples, please array labeled samples in order in a 2" cardboard box with a label of Project ID, name, and date.

## Sample Shipping
Upon submission of the OHMC request form, you will receive an email from us to coordinate sample hand off and timing.
