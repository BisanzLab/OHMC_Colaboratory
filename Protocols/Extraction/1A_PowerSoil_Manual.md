# PowerSoil Manual

## Theory

Describe here

## Materials

- [ ] PowerSoil Pro kit, Qiagen #47014
- [ ] 

## Preparation
- [ ] Wipe pipettes and work areas with DNaseAway or similar, treat area with UV light for ~15 minutes.
- [ ] Bring buffer CD2 out of fridge.
- [ ] Make sure that there is no precipitate in CD3 (SDS). If there is, heat in water bath until dissolved.
- [ ] All tubes can be set up and labeled ahead of time as shown:

  ## Sample Disruption

*Location: If samples are BSL2, conduct all work in Biosafety Cabinet, if BSL1, conduct all work in PCR cabinet.

- [ ] Briefly spin bead tubes to bring beads to bottom. Add up to 250mg of material and 800ul of CD1, vortex.
- [ ] Transfer tubes to bead beater (MPBio in BLS2 room or TissueLyser). Note: unit must be balanced. 
- [ ] Tighten ratchet(s) until they will no longer move.
- [ ] Run for 5 minutes at 25 Hz.
- [ ] Centrifuge tubes at 15,000g x 1min.

## DNA Extraction
*Location: DNA extraction hood

- [ ] While samples spin, aliquot 200ul/tube CD2 into the next row of microcentrifuge tubes.
- [ ]	Recover supernatant from power bead tubes and transfer to the corresponding tube containing CD2. Vortex 5sec to mix. (Note: avoid the pelleted beads/particles and pipet slowly; approximate recovery is around 400-500ul)
- [ ]	Centrifuge tubes at 15,000g x 1min.
- [ ]	While samples spin, aliquot 600ul/tube CD3 into the next row of microcentrifuge tubes.
- [ ]	Recover supernatant from tubes and transfer to the corresponding tube containing CD3. Vortex 5sec to mix. (Note: avoid the pellet and pipet slowly; approximate recovery is around 500-700ul)
- [ ]	Load up to 650ul each lysate onto a spin column.
- [ ] Centrifuge at 15,000g x 1min.
- [ ] Discard flow-through; load any remaining lysate to column.
- [ ] Centrifuge at 15,000g x 1min.
- [ ] Discard flow-through and collection tube; place each column in a new collection tube.
- [ ]	Add 500ul EA; Centrifuge at 15,000g x 1min.
- [ ]	Discard flow-through and re-use same collection tube.
- [ ]	Add 500ul C5; Centrifuge at 15,000g x 1min.
- [ ]	Discard flow-through and collection tube; place each column in a new collection tube.
- [ ]	Centrifuge at 15,000g x 2min to remove any residual wash buffer.
- [ ]	Place columns into elution tubes; Add 50ul DNase/RNase free water directly to the center of the membrane.
- [ ]	Centrifuge at 15,000g x 1min; Discard columns.
- [ ]	Depending on downstream applications, it may be desirable to array DNA samples in a 96-well PCR plate. 
- [ ]	Quantitate DNA by Qubit or Nanodrop and store at -20C.
