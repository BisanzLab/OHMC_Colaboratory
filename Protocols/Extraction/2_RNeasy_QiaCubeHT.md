# RNA Extraction using QiaCube HT

## Theory

Describe here

## Materials

- [ ] RNeasy 96 QIAcube HT kit (74171)
- [ ] QIAcube HT plasticware (950067)
- [ ] QIAzol (79306)
- [ ] RNase-free DNase (79254)
- [ ] PowerBead lysis tubes
- [ ] Ethanol
- [ ] Chloroform

## Considerations
Recommended starting material for Mammalian cells 5x10^5. Approximate yield 1.5-2 ug per 10^5 cells.
Recommended starting material for tissues is 40mg. For adipose tissue, up to 80mg. For thymus, spleen, or intesting only 20mg. If stored in RNAlater, use half of these amounts. More details are provided in the handbook.
Ideally tissues should be flash-frozen or processed immediately.
Maximim binding capacity for each column is 100ug RNA.

## Preparation
- [ ] ensure Ethanol has been added to Buffer RWT and Buffer RPE
- [ ] perform all steps at room temperature
- [ ] DO NOT use bleach at any step as it is not compatible with guanidine.

## Sample Disruption
- [ ] weigh tissues and put in PowerBead tubes on dry ice as quickly as possible. Do not allow tissues to thaw.
- [ ] remove tubes from dry ice and immediately add 750ul QIAzol per sample.
- [ ] secure tubes in TissueLyserII and run for 1 min at 25Hz. 
- [ ] allow the samples to rest 5 min.
- [ ] repeat the sample disruption and resting two more times for a total of three times.
After disruption, samples can be stored in Buffer RLT or Qiazol at -80C.

## RNA Extraction
*Location: DNA extraction hood
- [ ] allow samples to sit at room temperature 5 min.
- [ ] centrifuge at 6000xg for 1 min.
- [ ] add 150ul chloroform to each sample. 
- [ ] cap securely and shake vigorously with inversion for 15 sec.
- [ ] allow samples to sit at room temperature for 3 min.
- [ ] centrifuge at 6000xg for 15 min at 4C.
- [ ] recover the aqueous (upper) phase into a fresh S-block; the volume should be approximately 350ul.
- [ ] proceed to loading on the QIAcube HT.
