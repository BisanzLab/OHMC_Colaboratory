# DIY SPRI Beads
Nucleic acid purification from aqueous solutions by solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) on carboxylated paramagnetic beads is a simple method which can be automated for NGS library preparation. This protocol describes a recipe for beads that are of equal effectiveness in comparison to AMPure XP  beads and also more cost-effective.

# Materials
	[ ] 0.1% Sera-mag SpeedBeads (Cytiva 65152105050250)
	[ ] Magnet for bead capture
 	[ ] PEG-8000 (Thermo Scientific 3043443.36)
  •	sterile stock solutions:
	[ ] 0.5M EDTA, pH 8.0 (VWR E177)
	[ ] 1.0M Tris, pH 8.0 (Invitrogen 15568-025)
	[ ] Tween 20 (Sigma P9416)
	[ ] 5M NaCl ( SX0420-3)
# Protocol
1.  Add 9 g PEG-8000 to a sterile 50 mL conical tube.
2.  Add to this 50mL tube:
	[ ] 10 mL 5 M NaCL
	[ ] 500 µL 1 M Tris-HCl
	[ ] 100 µL 0.5 M EDTA
3.  Fill conical to ~ 49 mL using nuclease-free dH20.  
4.  Mix conical for about 3-5 minutes until PEG goes into solution.
5.  Add 27.5 uL Tween 20. Gently mix and set aside.
6.  In a separate 50 mL tube, prepare TE 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA:
	[ ] 500 µL 1 M Tris pH8 
	[ ] 100 µL 0.5 M EDTA
	[ ] fill conical to 50 mL mark with nuclease free dH20
7.	Mix Sera-mag SpeedBeads by inversion and transfer 1 mL to a 1.5 mL microtube.
8.	Place SpeedBeads on magnet stand until beads are drawn to magnet.
9.	Remove supernatant by pipetting.
10.	Add 1 mL TE to wash beads, remove from magnet, mix by flicking, return to magnet.
11.	Remove supernatant by pipetting.
12.	Repeat wash steps 10-11 two times.
13.	Remove bead tube from the magnet and mix with 1 mL TE . 
14.	Transfer to the 50 mL conical containing the PEG solution.
15.	Fill conical to 50 mL mark with dH20 (if not already there) and gently mix 50 mL conical until brown.
16.	Test against AMPure XP using aliquots of 100 bp ladder.
17.	Wrap in tinfoil (or place in dark container) and store at 4°C.
