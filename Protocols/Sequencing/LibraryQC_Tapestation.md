# Library QC by D1000 ScreenTape Assay

## Theory
The Agilent TapeStation is an automated platform for fast and sensitive electrophoresis. The D1000 ScreenTape assay is ideal for the reliable sample QC of libraries in the next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflow as well as PCR and qPCR products. Accurate sizing from 35 â€“ 1,000 bp can be assessed from only 1ul of sample in just a few minutes.

## Materials

- [ ] D1000 ScreenTape (Agilent 50675582, stored at 4C)
- [ ] D1000 Ladder and Sample Buffer (Agilent 5067-5583, stored at 4C)
- [ ] TapeStation loading tips (Agilent 5067*5599)
- [ ] Optical tube 8X strip (Agilent 401428) with cap (401425)


## Protocol
- [ ] Allow D1000 Sample buffer and ladder to equilibrate at room temperature for 30 min.
- [ ] During this time, set up the instrument. Launch the TapeStation Controller software.
- [ ] Flick the ScreenTape device, note the channels that have been already used, and insert it into the slot with the barcode facing back. The software will tell you if it is inserted incorrectly because it won't be able to read the barcode. The barcode will also tell the instrument which channels have been used, and if an additional device must be added to the tray.
- [ ] In the TapeStation software, select the sample positions for the number of tubes you are analyzing. The number of tips required will be displayed.
- [ ] Vortex reagents and samples, spin down. 
- [ ] Aliquot 3ul D1000 sample buffer in position A1 tube, add 1ul D1000 ladder. (Alternatively if you don't have the ladder you can select the electronic ladder in the software.)
- [ ] Aliquot 3ul D1000 sample buffer per sample tube. Add 1ul sample to it's respective tube.
- [ ] Apply caps (or seal if 96w plate). Vortex 2000rpm, 1 min. on the IKA.
- [ ] Spin down samples and ladder.
- [ ] Load the samples and ladder into the TapeStation. Select the appropriate wells, and to the right assign sample IDs.
- [ ] GENTLY remove the caps from the tubes so as not to disrupt the liquid.
- [ ] Remove the lid from the tips.
- [ ] REMEMBER TO REMOVE CAPS AND LIDS! Click Start and direct where your file should be saved.
- [ ] It takes about 8 min to run. When complete:
-   [ ] remove your samples
-   [ ] cover the tips
-   [ ] empty the tip bin
-   [ ] discard any fully used ScreenTape devices
-   [ ] keep any device that has unused channels, place it back in the foil at 4C and note how many were used.
