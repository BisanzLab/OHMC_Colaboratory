# NextSeq2000 XLEAP-SBS Sequencing Protocol

## Theory
After pooling equimolar amounts of the amplicon libraries and performing necessary clean up steps, the library can be diluted to 650pM with %phiX and run on the Illumina sequencer.

## Materials

- [ ] 


## Protocol
***Location:** clean benchtop*
- [ ] Wearing gloves, remove foil package containing the cartridge from the -20C, place the box on the benchtop with the cartridge on top allowing air to circulate all around it.
- [ ] Make sure the position of the cartridge is such that the label faces up. Thaw for 12 hours at room temperature, not exceeding 16 hours.
- [ ] Remove a flow cell from 4C, allowing it to come to room temperature for 15 minutes.
- [ ] Open the cartridge bag by tearing from the top notch on either side and remove the cartridge from the bag.
- [ ] Slowly invert the cartridge 10 times to mix reagents.
