# QIAmp MinElute Virus Spin Kit Extraction
**Objective**: Extract viral nucleic acids from a sample that has been previously purified on a CsCl gradient and contains virus-like particles (VLPs). The overall workflow of this extraction will be the following:
- **Lyse**
- **Bind**
- **Wash 1**
- **Wash 2**
- **Dry Spin**
- **Elute**

The kit includes an optional carrier-RNA addition. We have found that this is unnecessary and will complicate the quantification of low-yield virome extracts due to the overwhelming presence of the carrier RNA that is co-eluted with the sample.

## Materials and Reagents
- [ ] 0.9% NaCl for samples <200 µL
- [ ] 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes
- [ ] Ethanol (96-100%)
- [ ] Heating block for lysis of samples at 56°C
- [ ] Invitrogen Ultrapure Distilled Water (cat. no. 10977015)
- [ ] Microcentrifuge
- [ ] Pipet Tips with Aerosol Barriers
- [ ] QIAamp® MinElute® Virus Spin Kit (cat no. 57704)
- [ ] Vortexer

## 1. QIAMP MinElute Reagent Setup
If it is the first time utilizing this kit and the reagents have not been previously prepared, please do the following:
- Add 1.4 mL of Buffer AVE to a vial of lyophilized QIAGEN Protease. Mix carefully to avoid foaming. Divide into aliquots for storage at -20°C. 
- Add 310 µL of Buffer AVE to the tube containing the 310 μg lyophilized carrier RNA. Divide into aliquots for storage at -20°c. 

> [!NOTE]
> Do not undergo more than three freeze-thaw cycles with a single aliquot of the carrier RNA/Buffer AVE suspension.

- Add 25 ml of ethanol (96–100%) to a bottle containing 19 ml of Buffer AW1.
- Add 30 ml of ethanol (96–100%) to a bottle containing 13 ml of Buffer AW2 concentrate, as described on the bottle.

## 2. Important Points Before Initiation of Protocol
- Centrifugation is done at room temperature (15 - 26°C).
- Equilibrate samples to room temperature.
- Equilibrate elution buffer to room temperature.
- Prepare a 56°C heating block for lysis and drying procedures.

## 3. Nucleic Acid Extraction Procedure
- Add 75 μl QIAGEN Protease into a 2.0 ml microcentrifuge tube.
- Add 500 µL of sample to the microcentrifuge tube.
	- **Note**: If the sample volume is less than 500 µL, then bring the final volume up to 500 µL utilizing 0.9% NaCl.
- Add 500 µL of the Buffer AL mixture to the microcentrifuge tube. Pulse-vortex for 15 seconds.
- Incubate at 56°C for 15 minutes in the heating block.
- Briefly, centrifuge to collect the liquid that might've evaporated and cooled higher up in the microcentrifuge tube.
- Add 600 µL of ethanol (96-100%) to the sample, pulse-vortex for 15 seconds. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
- Briefly centrifuge the 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube. 
- In order to process all the of the lysate on the column, do the following:
	- Apply 700 µL of the lysate onto the QIAmp MinElute column, taking care not to wet the rim. Centrifuge at 6000 x g for 1 minute.
   	- Repeat as necessary to process all of the lysate in the 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube.
	- Place column into a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the old one. 
- Add 500 µL of Buffer AW1 to the column. Centrifuge at 6000 x g for 1 minute. Place the column into a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the old one. 
- Add 500 µL of Buffer AW2 to the column. Centrifuge at 6000 x g for 1 minute. Place the column into a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the old one. 
- Add 500 µL of ethanol (96-100%) to the column. Centrifuge at 6000 x g for 1 minute. Place into a new 2 mL collection tube. 
- Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 3 minutes to dry the column membrane completely. Place the column into a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the old one.
- Incubate the assembly, with the lid open, at 56°C for 3 minutes to dry the membrane completely and evaporate any remaining liquid. 
- Place the column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Discard the old one. With the desired elution volume (20 - 150 µL), incubate the membrane with the Ultrapure Distilled Water for 5 minutes. 
- Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 1 minute.
- Store at -80°C until ready for downstream use. 

The quantity and quality of extracted viral nucleic acids should be checked with the Qubit and Nanodrop.
