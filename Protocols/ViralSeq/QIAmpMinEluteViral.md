# QIAmp MinElute Virus Spin Kit Extraction
**Objective**: Extract viral nucleic acids from a sample that has been previously purified on a CsCl gradient and contains virus-like particles (VLPs). The overall workflow of this extraction will be the following:
- **Lyse**
- **Bind**
- **Wash 1**
- **Wash 2**
- **Dry Spin**
- **Elute**

The kit includes the use of carrier-RNA which serves two purposes: enhance the binding of viral nucleic acids to the spin filter membrane and reduce the chance of viral RNA being degraded by RNases. The failure to include the carrier-RNA in the protocol may result in reduced viral nucleic acid recovery. It is important to note that the carrier-RNA will greatly outnumber the recovered viral nucleic acids and may impact downstream amplification processes. Adjustment of the amount of carrier-RNA is thus to be determined on a case-by-case basis and is dependent upon your downstream applications. Qiagen determined that the optimal amount of carrier-RNA to add was 5.6 µg for optimal viral nucleic acid recovery. Use of less than this amount is to be subject to validation for each particular sample type and downstream assay.

## 1. QIAMP MinElute Reagent Setup
If it is the first time utilizing this kit and the reagents have not been previously prepared, please do the following:
- Add 1.4 mL of Buffer AVE to a vial of lyophilized QIAGEN Protease. Mix carefully to avoid foaming. Divide into aliquots for storage at -20°C. 
- Add 310 µL of Buffer AVE to the tube containing the 310 μg lyophilized carrier RNA. Divide into aliquots for storage at -20°c. 

> [!NOTE]
> Do not go through more than three freeze-thaw cycles with a single aliquot of the carrier RNA/Buffer AVE suspension.

- Add 25 ml of ethanol (96–100%) to a bottle containing 19 ml of Buffer AW1.
- Add 30 ml of ethanol (96–100%) to a bottle containing 13 ml of Buffer AW2 concentrate, as described on the bottle.

## 2. Important Points Before Procedure Initiation of Protocol
- Centrifugation is done at room temperature (15 - 26°C).
- Equilibrate samples to room temperature.
- Equilibrate elution buffer to room temperature.
- Prepare a 56°C heating block for use in the lysis and drying procedures.
- Add carrier RNA/Buffer AVE suspension to Buffer AL according to these instructions:
	- Calculate the volume of Buffer AL-carrier RNA mixture needed for the number of samples to be processed in batch:
	- **n** x 0.22 ml = y ml
	- **y** ml x 28 μl/ml = z μl
	- **n** = number of samples to be processed simultaneously
	- **y** = calculated volume of Buffer AL
	- **z** = volume of carrier RNA–Buffer AVE to add to Buffer AL
- Invert the mixture 10 times to mix. Avoid vortexing as it will result in the mixture foaming.


## 3. Nucleic Acid Extraction Procedure
- Add 25 μl QIAGEN Protease into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
- Add 200 µL of sample to the microcentrifuge tube.
	- **Note**: If the sample volume is less than 200 µL, then bring the final volume up to 200 µL utilizing 0.9% NaCl.
- Add 200 µL of the Buffer AL-carrier RNA mixture to the microcentrifuge tube. Pulse-vortex for 15 seconds.
- Incubate at 56°C for 15 minutes in the heating block.
- Briefly, centrifuge to collect the liquid that might've evaporated and cooled higher up in the microcentrifuge tube.
- Add 250 µL of ethanol (96-100%) to the sample, pulse-vortex for 15 seconds. Incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.
- Briefly centrifuge the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. 
- Apply the lysate onto the QIAmp MinElute column, taking care to not wet the rim. Centrifuge at 6000 x g for 1 minute. Place columns into a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the old one. 
- Add 500 µL of Buffer AW1 to the column. Centrifuge at 6000 x g for 1 minute. Place the column into a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the old one. 
- Add 500 µL of Buffer AW2 to the column. Centrifuge at 6000 x g for 1 minute. Place the column into a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the old one. 
- Add 500 µL of ethanol (96-100%) to the column. Centrifuge at 6000 x g for 1 minute. Place into a new 2 mL collection tube. 
- Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 3 minutes to dry the column membrane completely. Place the column into a new 2 mL collection tube and discard the old one.
- Incubate the assembly, with the lid open, at 56°C for 3 minutes to dry the membrane completely and evaporate any remaining liquid. 
- Place the column into a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Discard the old one. With the desired elution volume (20 - 150 µL), incubate the membrane with the Ultrapure Distilled Water for 5 minutes. 
- Centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 1 minute.
- Store at -80°C until ready for downstream use. 

Quantity and Quality of extracted viral nucleic acids are to be checked with the Qubit and Nanodrop.
