## Project and reagent requests

Please visit this [link](https://forms.gle/QxAVkzP4HyF7zvfQA) to request a project/reagents. Reagents will be allocated on first come/first serve basis and alignment with one health theme.

## Sample shipping

Do not send any samples to lab without first discussing project with Jordan. Please follow [these guidelines](https://github.com/BisanzLab/OHMC_Colaboratory/blob/main/Protocols/0_SampleRequirements.md) when shipping samples. Note: all extracted samples must be sent in full-skirt 96 well plates. Samples to be extracted must be sent in screw top cryovials. A separate sheet with the sample layout is required to protect against damage to labels during shipping.
